# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows one to keep record of file changes over time, and allows one to revert to previous versions, if necessary.  In the world of programming this is especially important, as bugs and crashes may spring up with new code and having that history is vital.



* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branching allows one (or multiple people) to work on different features or explore potential paths for a program without modifying the master file directly.  These branches can be merged into the master at a later time, or just abandoned if it doesn't work out.  The ability to branch makes coding much more flexible and collaborative.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a version of the file(s), which can be accessed at a later time.  Committing is essentially like saving a version that you can go back to, should you run into any issues in the future.  Committing often is a good practice.


* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts can occur when changes are made to the same line of code, or if a file that someone is trying to edit is deleted.  To resolve merge conflicts, changes from different branches can be reincorporated in a new commit.
