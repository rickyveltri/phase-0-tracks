ELEVATOR:

- If someone is approaching the elevator from outside, hit "door open"
- Ask users for floor numbers and retain as an array; sort
- set n = array[0]
- set x = n / 3
- Assuming the elevator has 3 buttons per row, starts with 1-2-3, then 4-5-6, etc), and our robot's "finger" is hovering over 1...
  - if n = 1, press inward
  - if n = 2, move right by one and press
  - if n % 3 = 0, move right by 2
    - where n = 3x, move up by x-1 and press
    [Spending a lot of time here, so going to move along.  Insert additional logic, including a "save point" for the machine's "finger" to base additional moves off of.]
- iterate up by one, setting n = array[1]
- repeat until end of array is reached
